GEPA Evaluation Results
=======================
Date: 2026-01-16
Model: openai/gpt-5.2

TRAINING RUN RESULTS (Validation Set)
-------------------------------------
Baseline:  0/3 (0.0%)
Optimized: 2/3 (66.7%) 

Pareto selection active: Yes
Generations: 4
Runtime: ~31 minutes
Cost: ~$3

TEST SET EVALUATION
-------------------
Tasks evaluated: 5 (from test split)

Baseline:  0/5 (0.0%)
Optimized: 0/5 (0.0%)

Note: Test set contained different task types than validation, the problems 
that GEPA optimized for were not present in the test set. This was just an example run
to demonstrate all the code is working.

CONCLUSION
----------
GEPA successfully optimized prompts on validation set (0% -> 66.7%)
but the optimized prompt did not generalize to the test set tasks.
This suggests the need for larger/more diverse training data.
