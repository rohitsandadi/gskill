    Your reasoning and analysis here. Explain why you want to perform the action.

    ```bash
    your_command_here
    ```

    Failure to follow these rules will cause your response to be rejected.

    Please solve this issue: {{task}}

    <returncode>{{output.returncode}}</returncode>
    {% if output.output | length < 10000 -%}
    <output>
    {{ output.output -}}
    </output>
    {%- else -%}
    <warning>
    The output of your last command was too long.
    Please try a different command that produces less output.
    If you're looking at a file you can try use head, tail or sed to view a smaller number of lines selectively.
    If you're using grep or find and it produced too much output, you can use a more selective search pattern.
    If you really need to see something from the full command's output, you can redirect output to a file and then search in that file.
    </warning>
    {%- set elided_chars = output.output | length - 10000 -%}
    <output_head>
    {{ output.output[:5000] }}
    </output_head>
    <elided_chars>
    {{ elided_chars }} characters elided
    </elided_chars>
    <output_tail>
    {{ output.output[-5000:] }}
    </output_tail>
    {%- endif -%}

    Please always provide EXACTLY ONE action in triple backticks, found {{actions|length}} actions.
    If you want to end the task, please issue the following command: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`
    without any other command.
    Else, please format your response exactly as follows:

    <response_example>
    Here are some thoughts about why you want to perform the action.

    ```bash
    <action>
    ```
    </response_example>

    Note: In rare cases, if you need to reference a similar format in your command, you might have
    to proceed in two steps, first writing TRIPLEBACKTICKSBASH, then replacing them with ```bash.
